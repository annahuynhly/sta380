    "text": "Lecture Information\nMonday 5:10 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. Please see the information on ACORN for location.\nFor the main course content, we will be following the second edition of “Statistical Computing with R” by Maria L. Rizzo.\nHowever, by the end of this course I expect students to be comfortable with the basics of R.\n\nStudents should know the material in chapters 2-4, 7 in “An Introduction to R” by Alex Douglas, Deon Roos, Francesca Mancini, Ana Couto & David Lusseau.\nSimilarly, students should learn more from chapters 2-4, 6 in “Advanced R” by Hadley Wickham.\nIt’s also good to skim “The R Inferno” by Patrick Burns to see the common R errors and best practices as a reference.\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\nOffice hours will be hosted online on zoom.\nThe link will be on Piazza and Quercus.\nThere will be a when2meet link sent as an announcement to ensure that office hours are constructed considering students’ general availability.\nThe teaching assistant, Ting Lin, will not have scheduled office hours but she was given ample Piazza hours and generally responds quickly to student inquires.\n\n\nTutorial Information\nTutorials will be held by Ting Lin.\nThe main focus of tutorials is to go over the practice quizzes and/or practice tests.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nThe official website details what the course will cover. To elaborate, I plan to cover the following:\n\nVarious methods for generating random variables, such as inverse-transform and the acceptance-rejection techniques. We will also explain mixtures.\nMonte Carlo integration, a method for estimating integrals (more specifically, expected values), and techniques to reduce the variance for this estimation.\nMonte Carlo methods, which briefly refers to any simulation-based method in statistical inference. We will start with examples students should be familiar with: simulating the mean, standard error, confidence intervals, MSE, bias, and hypothesis testing.\nBootstrap, a nonparametric Monte Carlo method used to estimate the distribution of a population by re-sampling, and Jackknife, another re-sampling method for estimating the bias and standard error.\nPermutation tests, used to show whether two samples come from the same distribution.\nProbability density estimation. We will discuss methods such as the Sturges’ rule, Scott’s rule, and the Freedman-Diaconis Rule.\nOptimization in R. We’ll do one dimension, using optimize() (run help(optimize) in R, and two dimensions, using optim() (run help(optim)). I’ll also explain Newton Raphson and the EM algorithm.\nLastly, I want students to leave this course being comfortable with the basics of R programming. Some instructors strongly believe in theory, and although that is important, coding is also a valuable skill that I believe needs more practice, even in the realm of generative AI."

In the above example, the key in that case would be voss2013introduction, so one would use @voss2013introduction.\nIn my example, I did not reference any citations. By default, citations only are referenced if you use then; to ensure that all are listed regardless of reference in the main text, you’ll need to do something similar to \\nocite{*}; see the example .tex file here.\nAlternative Method: Zotero\nNowadays, a lot of researchers use Zotero.

    "text": "Term Test 1\nPractice Test Version A | Practice Test Version B\nThe formula sheet for term test 1 will be different from term test 2 and the final exam.\nPractice tests are for students to get a general idea of the topics that may be asked and expectations.\nFor this term test, students should be comfortable with the following:\n\nPre-requisite material that have been shown during lecture (i.e., cdf, pdf, expected value, etc.)\nAll derivations and R codes regarding the inverse-transform and acceptance-rejection method as outlined in lecture and practice problems.\nGiven a transformation or convolution (i.e., if provided the relationship between a standard Gaussian and a chisquare distribution), students should be able to write in R code how to generate the requested distribution.\nUnderstand how mixture models work for generating random variables, the code used to generate them, and the difference between mixture and convolutions.\nIntroductory Monte Carlo methods for numerically estimating integrals (Section 1 of Unit 2 slides.) Both the written algorithm and how to code.\nUnderstanding how to use the SLLN (mostly for simple Monte Carlo methods).\n\nStudents will NOT be asked to do or remember the following:\n\nDerive a proof that heavily relies on analysis; i.e., the first proof done in lecture.\nTrick questions regarding whether the inverse-transform or the acceptance-rejection method is applicable or preferred in certain cases.\nMemorize all different combinations of transformations and convolutions between distributions; these will be supplied. Consult the practice test for examples.\nThe following definitions: convergence in probability and almost sure convergence.\nPlotting in R.\n\nRecommended preparation:\nIn order, where the first items are highly recommended.\n\nComplete both practice tests.\nRedo the practice quizzes.\nRedo the lecture slides (proof questions).\nRedo the tutorial problems.\nRedo the lecture slides (example questions).\nSee additional practice problems 2, 3, 4, and 5 — but for problem 5, do only questions 1 and 2. (Posted on Quercus only.) Do not worry about the box-muller transformation.\n\nMy approach for making problems:\nIf you are unsatisfied with the amount of practice questions, part of the beauty of this course is it’s quite feasible to make your own problems and double check with computations. You will learn a decent amount by trying to use these methods with different distributions that you pick online, especially to understand when inverse-transformation should be used and when acceptance-rejection is better.\nWhen I was making questions for the inverse-transform method, I essentially looked at undergraduate textbooks in 2nd probability for some simple distributions with a closed form cdf to try to simulate values.\nFor the acceptance-rejection method, I looked at common probability distributions that do not have a proper closed form and tried to simulate from them.\nConvolution methods are straightforward; I would recommend attempting every type of convolution I listed on the lecture slides to simulate.\nSimilarly, you may try different combinations of mixtures and simulate against the true density.\nSimple Monte Carlo methods are the easiest to make problems for, as we’re essentially estimating integrals. Simply search up any integral practice problem sheet of a first-year calculus class and instead of integrating, try to use the simple algorithm and compare to the true integral. For a more practical use case, you can just search for integrals without a closed form."

Most of the coding in R is to demonstrate that you know how to write the algorithms taught in lecture. In particular, students should be familiar with the following functions and how to do the following tasks:\n\nSetting a seed: set.seed()\nVariable assignment, either &lt;- or =\nInitialize a vector: x &lt;- c()\nBasic math operators & common functions\n\nAddition: +\nSubtraction: -\nMultiplication: *\nDivision: /\nExponents: ^ or **\nExponential: exp()\nNatural Logarithm: log()\n\nBasic logic operators (i.e., or: |, and: &, as well as &gt;=, ==, &lt;=, &gt;, &lt;)\nSimulate from a standard uniform distribution runif() and standard Gaussian rnorm(). We will give function and argument descriptions IF we require anything else similar to these. Examples of what we would PROVIDE, IF NEEDED, are below:\n\nUniform(a, b), N(mu = a, sigma = b), etc.\ndensity, dnorm(), quantile qnorm(), cdf pnorm(), etc.\nSimulations from other distributions such as gamma rgamma(), beta rbeta(), etc.\n\nWrite if/else statements, and ifelse()\nWrite for and while loops\nWrite functions and include arguments and the return() statement(s)\nWriting comments; use # before writing them\n(Not for term test 1) Loading a library: library(package_name)\n(Not for term test 1) Initializing matrices matrix()\n(Not for term test 1) Operations that can be performed on matrices. For example, if X is a matrix than exp(X) will apply the exponential function on every single value within the matrix X\n(Final examination only) How to use optimize() and optim(). IF NEEDED, we will supply the usage syntax for these, but we will not give a description.

    "section": "",
    "text": "TL;DR:\n\nThis course is crucial if you are planning graduate studies in statistics, especially if you do a thesis.\nIf you are only interested in doing ML and AI, this course is not needed. I recommend STA314 and STA315 instead. The CS courses, CSC311 and CSC413 are even better. However, if you need an extra statistics course for your degree, this is a better choice than time series analysis, survival analysis, etc.\nThis course has an emphasis on theoretical aspects, however, unlike other iterations of the course, there is also a large coding aspect. Coding skills are applicable. The project will give you a nice project to add to a resume, and you will confidently call yourself an R coder.\nThis is not a bird course, but you also shouldn’t be annihilated, as long as you regularly keep up with the material.\n\n\n\nLong Answer\nRecently, people have been recommending students to take this course. Furthermore, the course description mentions that computational methods play a central role in modern statistics and machine learning.\nThe former is undeniably true; you will employ computational statistics techniques in your thesis.\nI genuinely think if you take the course with me, you will be prepared for the coding aspects for most graduate programs in statistics, and your thesis supervisor should be satisfied with your R background.\nThe latter, referring to the machine learning aspect, is not necessarily true. They can be useful for machine learning, but it is not directly related the same way as the other statistics courses, STA314 and STA315 are. The CS courses are especially (and even more) relevant, such as CSC311 and CSC413. You may benefit from learning elementary Monte Carlo methods, bootstrap & jackknife, and numerical optimization.\nHowever, I would not be surprised if you never directly employ these approaches. Furthermore, most numerical optimization techniques are advanced; I will just mention how to use them in R. I’ll only cover the Newton Raphson and EM algorithms in detail.\nUnlike past iterations of the course, I highly believe statistics students should know how to code. You will need this skill for a career and modern graduate studies.\nHence, the project has a heavy R coding component, and there will be a coding aspect for the examinations. Don’t be too alarmed; the test page details what I expect students to be able to write by hand!\nAs an instructor, my teaching philosophy is as follows:\n\nI strive for students to know more than me when I was at their stage of their undergraduate career.\nA course should only be as difficult as the material being taught. The tests should be a reflection of the course content. I am not fond of “gotcha!” questions or are artificially difficult due to complicated computations.\nI want students to be adequately prepared for graduate studies, and/or be a sufficient R programmer.\n\nClearly, this will not be a bird course, and I am ambitious with the material being taught. But I don’t want students to drown and be worried about their GPA. At the same time, I want you to feel confident with the course content. Hence, the pacing may feel fast but I will be super clear with expectations for the examination to help ease the stress for students.\n\n\nReason for R\nIf you are getting into the ML and AI space, most things are done in python and you don’t need R.\nHowever, this is a statistics course. Most statistics research is done in R, not python.\nR is a good programming language for statisticians; and overall has a less barrier for entry for package development. Statisticians are not trying to be engineers. We mostly want to obtain the relevant numerical analysis for our statistical models.\nAfter all, it takes significantly less setup and lines of code for to obtain statistical information for a linear model and to graph a histogram in R than python\nThere has been recent development for python libraries to perform linear mixed modelling and structural equation models. However, these are not as well known in the statistics community (and uncertain of any possible issues for models of high dimensions or a more complicated covariance structure.)\nMost people should know both. There are already a lot of computer science courses that use python, and most undergraduate courses will not focus on R programming as much as this one."

Here are my following requirements:\n\nI must recognize your face and consequently your name. This can be from either regular lecture attendance or office hour visits. Note that in graduate studies, regular attendance is crucial.\nI can vouch for your academic ability. This can mean getting a good grade in my course (at least an A), as well as performing well in the course project. Actually, being able to successfully complete the course project would mean you have a lot of the computational skills for graduate school.\n(Optional but highly recommended) I must recognize your curiosity and thirst towards knowledge and knowledge contribution.\n\nIf you think you can meet these requirements, then I am willing to write an unlimited (within reason) amount of reference letters.

Analysing the answer a bit further, it is likely the case that we must take the ceiling() because the geometric distribution has a support that starts at 1, not 0, and thus a ceiling guarantees the value of \\(x\\) will be at least 1.\nThe first thing we proved in class is admittedly an analysis proof; I handwaved it.
