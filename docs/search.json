Ben Recht said it best:\n“Using Canvas means that course content lives behind an obnoxious campus IT firewall.”\nI will not privatize this website. I will let the world witness the content I have to offer.\nThat being said, some content that are personal will not be uploaded. The following will be on Quercus:\n\nAssessments\nPractice problems curated by previous instructors\nRecordings (if any)."

    "text": "Lecture Information\nMonday 5:10 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. Please see the information on ACORN for location.\nFor the main course content, we will be following the second edition of “Statistical Computing with R” by Maria L. Rizzo.\nHowever, by the end of this course I expect students to be comfortable with the basics of R.\n\nStudents should know the material in chapters 2-4, 7 in “An Introduction to R” by Alex Douglas, Deon Roos, Francesca Mancini, Ana Couto & David Lusseau.\nSimilarly, students should learn more from chapters 2-4, 6 in “Advanced R” by Hadley Wickham.\nIt’s also good to skim “The R Inferno” by Patrick Burns to see the common R errors and best practices as a reference.\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\nTBA… (I prefer to host them online if possible…)\n\n\nTutorial Information\nTBA…\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nThe official website details what the course will cover. To elaborate, I plan to cover the following:\n\nVarious methods for generating random variables, such as inverse-transform and the acceptance-rejection techniques. We also will explain mixtures.\nMonte Carlo integration, a method for estimating integrals (more specifically, expected values), and techniques to reduce the variance for this estimation.\nMonte Carlo methods, which briefly refers to any simulation-based method in statistical inference. We will start with examples students should be familiar with: simulating the mean, standard error, confidence intervals, MSE, bias, and hypothesis testing.\nBootstrap, a nonparametric Monte Carlo method used to estimate the distribution of a population by re-sampling, and Jackknife, another re-sampling method for estimating the bias and standard error.\nPermutation tests, used to show whether two samples come from the same distribution.\nProbability density estimation. We will discuss methods such as the Sturges’ rule, Scott’s rule, and the Freedman-Diaconis Rule.\nOptimization in R. We’ll do one dimension, using optimize() (run help(optimize) in R, and two dimensions, using optim() (run help(optim)). I’ll also explain Newton Raphson and the EM algorithm.\nLastly, I want students to leave this course being comfortable with the basics of R programming. Some instructors strongly believe in theory, and although that is important, coding is also a valuable skill that I believe needs more practice, even in the realm of generative AI."

    "text": "TL;DR:\n\nThis course is crucial if you are planning graduate studies in statistics, especially if you do a thesis.\nIf you are only interested in doing ML and AI, this course is not needed. I recommend STA314 and STA315 instead. The CS courses, CSC311 and CSC413 are even better. However, if you need an extra statistics course for your degree, this is a better choice than time series analysis, survival analysis, etc.\nThis course has an emphasis on theoretical aspects, however, unlike other iterations of the course, there is also a large coding aspect. Coding skills are applicable. The project will give you a nice project to add to a resume, and you will confidently call yourself an R coder.\nThis is not a bird course, but you also shouldn’t be annihilated, as long as you regularly keep up with the material.\n\n\n\nLong Answer\nRecently, people have been recommending students to take this course. Furthermore, the course description mentions that computational methods play a central role in modern statistics and machine learning.\nThe former is undeniably true; you will employ computational statistics techniques in your thesis.\nI genuinely think if you take the course with me, you will be prepared for the coding aspects for most graduate programs in statistics, and your thesis supervisor should be satisfied with your R background.\nThe latter, referring to the machine learning aspect, is not necessarily true. They can be useful for machine learning, but it is not directly related the same way as the other statistics courses, STA314 and STA315 are. The CS courses are especially (and even more) relevant, such as CSC311 and CSC413. You may benefit from learning elementary Monte Carlo methods, bootstrap & jackknife, and numerical optimization.\nHowever, I would not be surprised if you never directly employ these approaches. Furthermore, most numerical optimization techniques are advanced; I will just mention how to use them in R. I’ll only cover the Newton Raphson and EM algorithms in detail.\nUnlike past iterations of the course, I highly believe statistics students should know how to code. You will need this skill for a career and modern graduate studies.\nHence, the project has a heavy R coding component, and there will be a coding aspect for the examinations. Don’t be too alarmed; the test page details what I expect students to be able to write by hand!\nAs an instructor, my teaching philosophy is as follows:\n\nI strive for students to know more than me when I was at their stage of their undergraduate career.\nA course should only be as difficult as the material being taught. The tests should be a reflection of the course content. I am not fond of “gotcha!” questions or are artificially difficult due to complicated computations.\nI want students to be adequately prepared for graduate studies, and/or be a sufficient R programmer.\n\nClearly, this will not be a bird course, and I am ambitious with the material being taught. But I don’t want students to drown and be worried about their GPA. At the same time, I want you to feel confident with the course content. Hence, the pacing may feel fast but I will be super clear with expectations for the examination to help ease the stress for students.\n\n\nReason for R\nIf you are getting into the ML and AI space, most things are done in python and you don’t need R.\nHowever, this is a statistics course. Most statistics research is done in R, not python.\nR is a good programming language for statisticians; and overall has a less barrier for entry for package development. Statisticians are not trying to be engineers. We mostly want to obtain the relevant numerical analysis for our statistical models.\nAfter all, it takes significantly less setup and lines of code for to obtain statistical information for a linear model and to graph a histogram in R than python\nThere has been recent development for python libraries to perform linear mixed modelling and structural equation models. However, these are not as well known in the statistics community (and uncertain of any possible issues for models of high dimensions or a more complicated covariance structure.)\nMost people should know both. There are already a lot of computer science courses that use python, and most undergraduate courses will not focus on R programming as much as this one."
