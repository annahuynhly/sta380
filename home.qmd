Welcome to the STA380 website! Please see one of the headers above.

Most of the notes will be posted on this website instead of Quercus/Canvas. [Ben Recht said it best](https://www.argmin.net/p/machine-learning-evaluation-a-syllabus):

*"Using Canvas means that course content lives behind an obnoxious campus IT firewall."*

I will not privatize this website. I will let the world witness the content I have to offer.

That being said, some content that are personal will not be uploaded. The following will be on Quercus:

-   Assessments

-   Practice problems curated by previous instructors

-   Recordings (if any).
