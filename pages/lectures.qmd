-   Week 9 (March 2): Probability density estimation

-   Week 10 (March 9): TERM TEST 2

-   Week 11 (March 16): MCMC Methods

-   Week 13: (March 30): Review/Grace period...

I understand the lecture times are late at night, and many people may be sick during the winter session. There will be a zoom link for the live lectures, although I encourage students to arrive as I will not be monitoring the zoom chat (and it is harder for me to answer questions.)

Solutions to lecture notes will be posted upon completion of a section. Recordings may be uploaded but no promises (in case a file gets corrupted, quality is poor, etc.)

I recommend against rushing everything until last second. The assessments will be difficult if you do not come to lecture regularly and ask questions. The examinations should be reasonable otherwise.
