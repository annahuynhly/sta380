I understand the lecture times are late at night, and many people may be sick during the winter session. There will be a zoom link for the live lectures, although I encourage students to arrive physically as I will not be monitoring the zoom chat (and it is harder for me to answer questions.)

Solutions to lecture notes will be posted upon completion of a section. Recordings may be uploaded on Quercus but no promises (in case a file gets corrupted, quality is poor, etc.)

I recommend against rushing everything until last second. The assessments will be difficult if you do not come to lecture regularly and ask questions. The examinations should be reasonable otherwise.

The codes below were my prepared notes. Some of them differ significantly from lecture, where I am coding on the spot. (The live code can be found in the agenda.)

[R Code - Acceptance Rejection](../coding/lecture/unit1_acceptreject.R)

[R Code - Convolution](../coding/lecture/unit1_convolution.R)

[R Code - Mixtures](../coding/lecture/unit1_mixtures.R)

If you saw an earlier version of this website, you've noticed I removed covering MCMC methods. This is because most instructors advised not adding too much. That being said, if I have an ambitious cohort I may re-add it! :D
