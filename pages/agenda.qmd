Plans may change. This includes what we have completed week by week.

## Week 1

**Lecture (January 5):** Generating Random Variables (Inverse Transform)

In this lecture we covered all of the inverse-transform methods, although we skipped the recursive question regarding the logarithmic distribution due to time.

[Live January 5 code](../coding/live_lecture/jan5_code.R)

The typo was that I used `n` when I should have used `m` when generating from the uniform distribution.

In the lecture I initially argued that we should be using the `floor()` function, but then in my past notes I used `ceiling()`. Analysing the answer a bit further, it is likely the case that we must take the `ceiling()` because the geometric distribution has a support that starts at `1`, not `0`, and thus a ceiling guarantees the value of $x$ will be at least 1.
