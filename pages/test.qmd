I plan to have a clear outline of topics I expect students to know for the tests and supply 2-3 practice quizzes/tests of a similar difficulty.

In general, I believe if you know genuinely how to solve questions shown in lecture, tutorials, and practice problems, then I believe there should be no problem obtaining 80%+ in the course.

The main issue is that I want to cover a lot of material for this course. So don't leave everything to the last minute!
