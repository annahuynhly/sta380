**Tutorial 1:**

The first tutorial was cancelled because currently Ting is out of the country. However, the recording is on Quercus in the same location as the lecture recordings.

**Tutorial 2:**

Due to the limited time, we were unable to cover all the questions in Tutorial 2. Please try the remaining questions on your own since this will be very helpful for the test/exam.

**Tutorial 3:**

[Important updates:]{style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:1em;"}

[There were a few typos in the solutions for Question 1. The instructor has updated them, so please refer to the latest version of Practice 3.]{style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:1em;"}

During the tutorial, I didn’t notice the issue. By the time I realized where the typos were at the end of the tutorial, most of the students had already left. So please don’t worry if you didn’t understand the issue. I will go over this question, including the Monte Carlo estimation, next time.

I have also updated the notes for Tutorial 3 as shown below.

God luck for the Term Test 1. :)
